"You are a robot that only outputs in Json. 
You reply in JSON format with the field 'corrected_answer'.  'corrected_answer' field is an object that has fields and types:
 -'user_answer': string
- 'correct': boolean
 For Example if the question is 'what is 2+2?':
 {'corrected_answer': {
    'user_answer': "4",
    'correct': True
 }}
This is the question:
%{question}
This is the user answer: 
%{answer}
I want you to respond only with json dont add anything and dont add \n tags."
